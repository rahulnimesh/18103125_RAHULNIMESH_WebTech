//a few description about programs

1)Anagram.java - this is the program for checking whether two strings are anagram. Both the strings are taken as input from user using java Scanner class

2)WordReplacer.java - In this program paragraph is taken as input from user which i stored in a array(each word at a diffrent index) and input is terminated
   by telling user how to terminate input.Second input is the words that are to be replaced in paragraph which i stored in an another array and input is
   terminated by telling user how to terminate Then i replaced the given words accordingly in the paragraph and printed the modified paragraph.
   
3)Substring.java - Two strings are taken input from user as one is main string another is string that is to be found as substring in main string.So based on
                   frequency of characters in string i calculated the no. of occurrence of substring in main string.
				
4)Spath.java - In this program i have implemented graph using adjacency matrix(a 2d array).First input from user is- no. of vertex, 2nd input- no. of edges,
               3rd input- edges seperated by space(for eg: if there is edge between 1 and 2 so user will enter 1 2), 4th input- source vertex, destination vertex.
			   Then using BFS i have found shortest path.
